### ! IMPORTANT: this example is not maintained and will not be upgraded along with Flutter updates. This means that this example will not word out of the box, but inspecting the code yourself can still give you an idea on how to implement both packages yourself.

# flutter_chromecast_example

Example of an implementation of your iOS or Android device as a ChromeCast sender. Uses [flutter_mdns_plugin](https://github.com/terrabythia/flutter_mdns_plugin) for discovering the ChromeCast devices (because this cannot be done purely in Dart) and uses [dart_chromecast](https://github.com/terrabythia/dart_chromecast) to communicate with a connected ChromeCast (purely in Dart).

The [dart_chromecast](https://github.com/terrabythia/dart_chromecast) project is still under development and that's mainly why this example is also still very simple, but as the dart_chromecast project grows, so will this example implementation of it.

**Usage**

Make sure you have the latest version of Dart and Flutter installed. 
Clone this project, get pub dependencies and just run! 
Works both in the simulator and on a real device.
